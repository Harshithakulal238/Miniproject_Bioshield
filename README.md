# 🌿 AI Model for Identifying Invasive Plant Species (BioShield:AI)

## 🧠 Overview
This project, **BioShield:AI**, focuses on developing an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model capable of identifying invasive plant species from images.  
It aims to support biodiversity conservation by enabling early detection and awareness of invasive species that threaten native ecosystems.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a deep learning model to classify invasive plant species using image datasets.  
- Provide an intuitive **React-based frontend** for users to upload plant images.  
- Integrate awareness and information modules for each detected species.  
- Enable collaboration and data sharing among research and academic teams.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
### 🧩 Machine Learning
- **Google Colab** – Model training and experimentation  
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – Deep learning model  
- **NumPy, Matplotlib** – Data preprocessing and visualization  

### 💻 Frontend
- **React.js** – Interactive UI for image upload and results  
- **Tailwind CSS / Material UI** – Styling and layout  

### 🗄️ Backend (optional)
- **Flask / FastAPI** – To serve the trained AI model (if integrated)

### ☁️ Cloud / Storage
- **Google Drive** – Dataset and model storage  
- **GitHub** – Code collaboration and version control

## 🧬 Dataset
The dataset consists of **images of invasive plant species**, organized folder-wise by species name.  
Each folder contains multiple labeled images used for model training and testing.
